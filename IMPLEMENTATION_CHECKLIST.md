## üéØ Priority Implementation Order

1. **High Priority**
   - Run database migration
   - Implement Thymeleaf views for job listing and application
   - Complete RecruitmentController methods
   - Update SecurityConfig for role-based access

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Create recruitment dashboard
   - Implement interview scheduling logic
   - Add notification system (simulated)
   - Generate basic reports

3. **Low Priority**
   - Advanced resume parsing (PDF/DOCX)
   - Enhanced AI algorithms
   - Analytics and charts
   - Email integration

## üöÄ Quick Start for Development

1. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   psql -U username -d spring-ats -f db/recruitment_schema.sql
   ```

2. Update user roles in database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_groups SET group_name = 'Candidate' WHERE group_name = 'Student';
   ```

3. Start implementing views in `src/main/resources/templates/recruitment/`

4. Test AI screening with sample resumes

## üìù Notes

- AI algorithm is intentionally simple (keyword matching) for educational purposes
- Can be enhanced with Apache Tika for PDF parsing
- Can integrate Apache OpenNLP for advanced NLP features
- Email notifications can use Spring Mail or be simulated for demo
