## AI Screening Algorithm

The AI screening service uses keyword matching:
- Extracts required skills from job posting
- Searches for each skill in resume text (case-insensitive)
- Calculates match percentage: (matched_skills / total_skills) Ã— 100
- Stores matched keywords for recruiter review
- Ranks candidates by AI score (descending)

## Notes

- Resume text extraction currently supports plain text files
- For production, integrate PDF/DOC parsing libraries (Apache PDFBox, Apache POI)
- AI algorithm can be enhanced with NLP, semantic matching, and experience weighting
