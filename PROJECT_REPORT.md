## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Project Overview

The AI-Enabled Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is a comprehensive web-based application designed to automate and streamline the recruitment process using artificial intelligence technologies. This system addresses the growing need for efficient candidate management in today's competitive job market by providing intelligent resume screening, automated workflow management, and comprehensive recruitment analytics.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional recruitment processes face several challenges:
- Manual resume screening is time-consuming and prone to human bias
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria across different recruiters
- Difficulty in managing large volumes of applications
- Lack of standardized tracking and reporting mechanisms
- Poor candidate experience due to delayed responses

### 1.3 Objectives

**Primary Objectives:**
- Automate and streamline the recruitment process using AI-enhanced applicant tracking technology
- Reduce manual workload on recruiters and improve candidate shortlisting accuracy
- Deliver a scalable, user-friendly solution for real-world HR use

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Implement role-based access control for different user types
- Provide comprehensive recruitment analytics and reporting
- Ensure data security and privacy compliance
- Create an intuitive user interface for all stakeholders

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
- Multi-role user management (Admin, Recruiter, Candidate)
- Complete recruitment workflow automation
- AI-based resume analysis and candidate scoring
- Real-time application tracking and status updates
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

**Limitations:**
- Advanced ML/NLP-based screening limited to prototype/demo due to scope constraints
- Email/SMS notifications may rely on simulation for demonstration
- Security features designed for educational purposes, not enterprise production

## 2. LITERATURE SURVEY

### 2.1 Evolution of Applicant Tracking Systems

Applicant Tracking Systems have evolved from simple database applications to sophisticated AI-powered platforms. Early systems focused primarily on data storage and basic filtering capabilities. Modern ATS solutions incorporate machine learning algorithms for intelligent candidate matching and predictive analytics.

### 2.2 AI in Recruitment

Recent research in AI-driven recruitment has shown significant improvements in:
- Resume parsing accuracy using Natural Language Processing
- Bias reduction through standardized evaluation criteria
- Predictive analytics for candidate success probability
- Automated interview scheduling and communication

### 2.3 Technology Stack Analysis

**Backend Technologies:**
- Spring Boot: Provides robust enterprise-grade application framework
- Spring Security: Comprehensive authentication and authorization
- JPA/Hibernate: Object-relational mapping for database operations
