## ✅ Step 3: SecurityConfig Updated

**Status:** COMPLETED

Updated `SecurityConfig.java` with role-based access control:

### Access Rules:

## ✅ Step 4: AI Screening Tested

**Status:** COMPLETED

### Test Suite Created:
Location: `test-resumes/`

**Sample Resumes:**
1. **sample-resume-high-match.txt** - 100% match (all 7 skills)
2. **sample-resume-medium-match.txt** - 42.86% match (3/7 skills)
3. **sample-resume-low-match.txt** - 0% match (no skills)

**Test Script:** `test-ai-screening.sh`

### AI Screening Algorithm:
- Keyword-based matching (case-insensitive)
- Score calculation: (matched_skills / total_skills) × 100
- Matched keywords extraction
- Candidate ranking by AI score

### Testing Results:
| Resume | Expected Score | Matched Skills | Status |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| High Match | 100% | 7/7 | ✓ Pass |
| Medium Match | 42.86% | 3/7 | ✓ Pass |
| Low Match | 0% | 0/7 | ✓ Pass |
